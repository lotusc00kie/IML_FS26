# This serves as a template which will guide you through the implementation of this task. It is advised
# to first read the whole template and get a sense of the overall structure of the code before trying to fill in any of the TODO gaps.
# First, we import necessary libraries:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold

# Add any additional imports here (however, the task is solvable without using 
# any additional imports)
